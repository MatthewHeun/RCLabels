with notation that includes a prefix and a suffix,
with corresponding separators or start-end string sequences.
There are several functions to generate specialized versions
or otherwise manipulate row and column names on their own or as row or column names.
flip_pref_suff() Switches the location of prefix and suffix, such that the prefix becomes the suffix, and
the suffix becomes the prefix.
E.g., &quot;a -&amp;gt; b&quot; becomes &quot;b -&amp;gt; a&quot; or &quot;a [b]&quot; becomes &quot;b [a]&quot;.
get_pref_suff() Selects only prefix or suffix, discarding notational elements
and the rejected part.
Internally, this function calls split_pref_suff() and selects only the desired portion.
notation_vec() Builds a vector of notation symbols in a standard format.
By default, it builds a list of notation symbols that provides an arrow
separator (&quot; -&amp;gt; &quot;) between prefix and suffix.
paste_pref_suff() paste0's prefixes and suffixes, the inverse of split_pref_suff().
Always returns a character vector.
preposition_notation() Builds a list of notation symbols that provides (by default) square brackets around the suffix with a preposition (&quot;prefix [preposition suffix]&quot;).
split_pref_suff() Splits prefixes from suffixes, returning each in a list with names pref and suff.
If no prefix or suffix delimiters are found, x is returned in the pref item, unmodified,
and the suff item is returned as &quot;&quot; (an empty string).
If there is no prefix, and empty string is returned for the pref item.
If there is no suffix, and empty string is returned for the suff item.
switch_notation() Switches from one type of notation to another based on the from and to arguments.
Optionally, prefix and suffix can be flipped.


Parts of a notation vector are
&quot;pref_start&quot;, &quot;pref_end&quot;, &quot;suff_start&quot;, and &quot;suff_end&quot;.
None of the strings in a notation vector are considered part of the prefix or suffix.
E.g., &quot;a -&amp;gt; b&quot; in arrow notation means that &quot;a&quot; is the prefix and &quot;b&quot; is the suffix.
If sep only is specified for notation_vec() (default is &quot; -&amp;gt; &quot;),
pref_start, pref_end, suff_start, and suff_end are
set appropriately.
For functions where the notation argument is used to identify portions of the row or column label
(such as split_pref_suff(), get_pref_suff(),
and the from argument to switch_notation()),
(Note: flip_pref_suff() cannot infer notation, because it switches prefix and suffix in a known, single notation.)
if notation is a list, it is treated as a store from which
the most appropriate notation is inferred by infer_notation(choose_most_specific = TRUE).
Because default is RCLabels::notations_list,
notation is inferred by default.
The argument choose_most_specific tells what to do when two notations match a label:
if TRUE (the default), the notation with most characters is selected.
If FALSE, the first matching notation in notation will be selected.
See details at infer_notation().
If specifying more than one notation, be sure the notations are in a list.
notation = c(RCLabels::bracket_notation, RCLabels::arrow_notation)
is unlikely to produce the desired result, because the notations
are concatenated together to form a long string vector.
Rather say
notation = list(RCLabels::bracket_notation, RCLabels::arrow_notation).
For functions that construct labels (such as paste_pref_suff()),
notation can be a list of notations
over which the paste tasks is mapped.
If notation is a list, it must have as many items as
there are prefix/suffix pairs to be pasted.
If either pref or suff are a zero-length character vector
(essentially an empty character vector
such as obtained from character())
input to paste_pref_suff(),
an error is thrown.
Instead, use an empty character string
(such as obtained from &quot;&quot;)."><title>Row and column notation — row-col-notation • RCLabels</title><script src="../deps/jquery-3.6.0/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"><link href="../deps/bootstrap-5.3.1/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"><script src="../deps/bootstrap-5.3.1/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><!-- Font Awesome icons --><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha256-mmgLkCYLUQbXn0B1SRqzHar6dCnv9oZFPEC1g1cwlkk=" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/v4-shims.min.css" integrity="sha256-wZjR52fzng1pJHwx4aV2AO3yyTOXrcDW7jBpJtTwVxw=" crossorigin="anonymous"><!-- bootstrap-toc --><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@v1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js" integrity="sha256-4veVQbu7//Lk5TSmc7YV48MxtMy98e26cf5MrgZYnwo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- headroom.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-AsUX4SJE1+yuDu5+mAVzJbuYNPHj/WroHuZ8Ir/CkE0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/jQuery.headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZX/yNShbjqsohH1k95liqY9Gd8uOiE1S4vZc+9KQ1K4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- clipboard.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/clipboard.js/2.0.6/clipboard.min.js" integrity="sha256-inc5kl9MA1hkeYUt+EC3BhlIgyp/2jDIyBLS6k3UxPI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- search --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fuse.js/6.4.6/fuse.js" integrity="sha512-zv6Ywkjyktsohkbp9bb45V6tEMoWhzFzXis+LrMehmJZZSys19Yxf1dopHx7WzIKxr5tK2dVcYmaCk2uqdjF4A==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/autocomplete.js/0.38.0/autocomplete.jquery.min.js" integrity="sha512-GU9ayf+66Xx2TmpxqJpliWbT5PiGYxpaG8rfnBEk1LL8l1KGkRShhngwdXK1UgqhAzWpZHSiYPc09/NwDQIGyg==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mark.js/8.11.1/mark.min.js" integrity="sha512-5CYOlHXGh6QpOFA/TeTylKLWfB3ftPsde7AnmhuitiTX4K5SqCLBeKro6sPS8ilsz1Q4NRx3v8Ko2IBiszzdww==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- pkgdown --><script src="../pkgdown.js"></script><meta property="og:title" content="Row and column notation — row-col-notation"><meta property="og:description" content="It is often convenient to represent matrix row and column names
